Automatically enerate UML-Sequence diagrams from Python code traces.

## Requirements ##

This project uses seqdiag a simple sequence-diagram image generator.
http://blockdiag.com/en/seqdiag/index.html

As debian packet: python3-seqdiag

## ToDo ##

- Add sample code file
- Add model class for sequences than export from there
- Add test file
- Add Makefile with tests linters runs etc
- Also derive object's code names (is it possible?)
- Find a real-life example
- Add filter to filter unwanted objects
- Add trick to filter sys & os calls that are handled in C (e.g. os.system)
- Clone output to file instead of console
- Add license info
- Any way to debug??? We cannot trace and debug at the same time!
  - Can we test this nicely ?
